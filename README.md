# INSY 695 Final Project
## Group 3: Fourchetteurs

### Project Overview
This project aims to enhance the effectiveness of direct marketing campaigns for banks using machine learning. By leveraging a dataset from the University of California Irvineâ€™s Machine Learning Repository, we explored innovative strategies to attract new clients and retain existing ones, transitioning from traditional to data-driven marketing approaches.

### Business Context
The banking environment is competitive and traditionally rigid. Our objective is to use bank marketing data to personalize marketing strategies for banking institutions. This would allow for more efficient allocation of their resources and higher conversion rates, ultimately increasing profitability. Our dataset consists of 45,211 rows and 21 columns, including both numerical and categorical variables. It details the marketing campaigns conducted via phone calls of a Portuguese bank. To do this, we will be using two types of models: classification and clustering.

### Modelling Context
Classification Models: We predict the likelihood of a client subscribing to a term deposit, focusing on those with the highest likelihood to convert. This approach helps in personalizing marketing efforts and reducing costs. Our goal for our predictive classification is to predict client subscription to term deposits.

Clustering Models: We segment the bank's clients based on various characteristics, allowing for tailored marketing strategies that are more effective in engaging distinct client groups. Our segmentation goal is to identify distinct client segments for targeted marketing.

### Hypotheses
*"Classification techniques will accurately predict subscription likelihood based on client traits and previous campaign interactions."*

*"Clustering algorithms will reveal distinct groups within the client base, highlighting various patterns and characteristics for targeted marketing."*
